# Mod-3-Project

#### Ben Inoyatov

## Introduction
---
Data comes from Kaggle ( [link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) ). 
Most visualizations were done using ``` seaborn ``` and ``` matplotlib ```. For regression I used ``` sklearn ```, ``` pandas ``` and ``` numpy ```.

For more detailed visualizations and exploratory analysis refer to ``` workbook ```. 
### The Question 
---
- Under represented groups suffer more from disease and illness in America than others. This project will focus on predicting diabetes in Pima Native American Woman Can we accurately predict diabetes in minority groups? We will use patient statistics like glucose level, insulin level, age, BMI, family history, blood pressure and others.

- This pair plot shows relation to glucose level, an important factor to diabetes. You can clearly see the difference between outcomes.

- Similiar results for insulin levels. Note: insulin values were among most of the missing values. Imputation will make our models more biased but numbers were imputed keeping the original distributions in mind.

- The best model
