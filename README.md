## Introduction
---
- Under represented groups suffer the most from disease and illness in America. This project will focus on predicting diabetes in Pima Native American Woman 
### Our Question 
---
- Minority groups in the United States are suffering worse from disease than others. Can we accurately predict diabetes in minority groups? We will use patient statistics like glucose level, insulin level, age, BMI, family history, blood pressure and others. 

###  Select Observations/Findings and Conclusions

- This pair plot shows relation to glucose level, an important factor to diabetes. You can clearly see the difference between outcomes.

- Similiar results for insulin levels. Note: insulin values were among most of the missing values. Imputation will make our models more biased but numbers were imputed keeping the original distributions in mind.
